# 🍺 Alcohol System

Enhance roleplay realism with an advanced alcohol consumption and intoxication system! From casual drinks to breathalyzer tests and medical interventions, this script brings immersion and consequences to in-game drinking.

---

## 🍷 Alcohol Consumption

Players can consume various alcoholic beverages, each affecting their **BAC (blood alcohol content)** differently:

- **Alcohol Level:** Each drink (e.g., beer, wine, vodka) has a different effect on the body.
- **Drink Notification:** Players receive contextual messages like *"You drank a beer"*.
- **Drink Prop:** A visual prop appears in the player's hands while drinking.

---

## 🚗 Difficulty Driving Vehicles

When BAC is high, driving becomes a serious challenge. Effects include:

- Sluggish or delayed vehicle control  
- Impaired coordination and input randomness  
- Realistic risk of accidents

---

## 🤢 Ragdoll Effect at High BAC

At high intoxication levels, players may randomly fall down due to ragdoll effects — adding both realism and fun chaos to the game.

---

## ⚠️ Loss of Character Control

Excessive drinking causes the player to lose control, with:

- Random movement patterns  
- Delayed or unresponsive controls  
- Unpredictable animations

---

## 🧪 Breathalyzer – BAC Measurement

Specific groups (e.g., medics, police) can use a **breathalyzer** item to measure a player’s BAC level using the targeting system.

---

## 💉 Artificial Detox (Stomach Lavage)

Authorized personnel (e.g., paramedics) can perform **stomach pumping** to cleanse the body and reduce BAC instantly — a great roleplay tool in emergency scenarios.

---

## 🧠 Stages of Intoxication

Four progressive levels of alcohol influence add depth to gameplay:

- 🟢 **Tipsy** – Slight movement or visual effects  
- 🟡 **Drunk** – Noticeable impairment and movement changes  
- 🔴 **Very Drunk** – Severe gameplay difficulty  
- ⚫ **Extremely Drunk (Wasted)** – The character is barely usable, with random falls and disorientation

Each stage introduces unique animations and behaviors that reflect the character’s condition.
